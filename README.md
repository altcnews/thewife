## Installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/pythonjokeun/thewife`

## Usage

This bot only works on **Python 3**.

1. Setup a `.yaml` configuration file, for example `my-config-file.yaml`.

2. Simply run `wife --config my-config-file.yaml`, where `my-config-file.yaml` is the configuration file that you've setup from the first step.

## Configuration File:

In order to start the bot you need a configuration file. Below, is the structure of configuration file.

```
creds:
  account:
    exchange: '...'
    apikey: '...'
    apisec: '...'
  pushbullet:
    token: '...'

trade:
  pair: '...'
  funds: ...
  candlestick: '...'
  history: ...
  ordercheck: ...
```

Fields surrounded with quotes (`'...'`) are expecting string as input, and without quotes (`...`) are expecting numeric value as input.

Since this bot uses [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) to interact with exchanges' APIs, some of the configuration values for this bot are inherited from [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) configuration values. For possible values for all of these fields below, refer to the linked page.

- [exchange](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#exchanges), contains name of the trading exchange (e.g **binance**).
- [pair](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#symbols-and-market-ids), contains name of trading pair (e.g **BTC/USDT**).
- [candlestick](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#ohlcv-candlestick-charts), contains size of the candlestick (e.g **1h**).
- [history](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#ohlcv-candlestick-charts), contains candlestick history size (e.g **100**).

The rest of configuration fields are explained below.

- `token`, contains your [pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) API access token.
- `funds`, contains amount of base currency you would like to trade.
- `ordercheck`, contains seconds interval for checking placed order.

Notice that, [pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) API access token is mandatory at the moment, so any buy / sell activity won't out of your sight.
